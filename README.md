# Machine Learning Final-Project
Final Project for Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Machine Learning Module

Mar 5, 2018 final submission.

This was a very intense Machine Learning module of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.

Run the poi_id.py python program which will call the other programs and load the data.

The pdf document is the review by Udacity team.

This was my first Machine Learning project. 

I've since received / completed the Udacity certificate for the Data Analytics Nanodegree, 
but I'm still learning, and will continue learning and practicing. :)
